# Groep-1-weBuddy-IT-Project

As first-year students, we all faced the same doubts and challenges. Now, imagine going through that same year with the support of a buddy who has already been there. How different would your experience have been?

# Our idea

weBuddy is an all-in-one platform built to guide and empower students through every step of their journey. It's more than just a place to find a buddy, the website itself becomes a buddy, offering resources, advice, and connections per degree.

# Key features

1. Q&A forums: _Ask and answer questions, share your knowledge and earn points!_
2. Find a mentor: _Connect with a peer to study together, share experiences, or just find support._
3. Course information: _Access all sorts of resources, including study tips, summaries, notes and so on, to always stay up to date._
4. Student journeys: _Discover personal experiences shared by other students, from overcoming challenges to achieving milestones._

# How?

The website will be managed by mentors (buddies, tutors and ebuddies). They will oversee content and ensure that information is accurate and helpful. Making the platform a safe space for students is one of our top priorities.
