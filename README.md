# Groep-1-weBuddy-IT-Project

As first-year students, we all faced the same doubts and challenges. Now, imagine going through that same year with the support of a buddy who has already been there. How different would your experience have been?

# Our idea

weBuddy is an all-in-one platform built to guide students through every step of their journey. It's more than just a place to find a buddy; the website itself becomes a buddy, offering resources, advice, and connections per degree. Here's how it works:

# Key features

1. Q&A forums
2. Find a Buddy
3. Course information
4. Student journeys

# How?

The website will be managed by mentors (buddies, tutors and ebuddies). They will oversee content and ensure that information is accurate and helpful.
